# TorrentCLI

TorrentCLI is a simple command-line tool to get your completely legal torrents with ease. The project aims to mimic the capabilities of [pirate-get](https://github.com/vikstrous/pirate-get), from which I take inspiration, and make it more flexible to expand the search to other famous web sites in addition to Pirate Bay.
I'm still in an early stage on the development of this application and probably in the near major modification will be made, still, the main capabilities are available and ready to use.
